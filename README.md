# EM Software Repository

This repository contains many tools and functions, useful for electromagnetic
simulations, with a particular focus on the study of solar cells.

The tools are separated into different submodules, that refer to different
studies/works:

1. (colour_algo) Algorithms to determine colour from reflection data
2. (lumerical) Functions to interact with the Ansys Lumerical FDTD and CHARGE
   software suites
3. (formulas) Refractive index dispersion formulas
4. (optics) Refractive index mixing, via Bruggerman
4. (optimization) Particle swarm optimization algorithm
5. (pv) Useful functions for PV analysis
6. (smatrix) Scattering Matrix Method implementation
7. (utilities) General useful function

## Scientific Publications

Most of these tools have been created to facilitate research in the area
of solar cells, such that many of the components are associated with
scientific publications. Considering that, if you used these tools, please
add a citation to either the repository, or to the relevant publication,
associated with the tool, as defined below.
