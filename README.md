# EM Software Repository

This repository contains many tools and functions, useful for electromagnetic
simulations.

The tools include in the different submodules:

1. Algorithms to determine colour from reflection data (colour_algo)
2. Functions to interact with the Ansys Lumerical FDTD and CHARGE programs
   (lumerical)
3. Several refractive index dispersion formulas (formulas) and refractive index
   mixing, via Bruggerman (optics)
4. Particle swarm optimization algorithm (optimization)
5. Useful functions for PV analysis (pv)
6. Scattering Matrix Method implementation (smatrix)
7. General useful function (utilities)

Several of these tools have been created as an important component and tool of
scientific publications in the area of solar cells. The list, of relevant
articles are shown below.
